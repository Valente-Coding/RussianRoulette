# How to play

Russian roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body (of the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel, the weapon will fire, killing or severely injuring the player.

During the course of the game, the player is presented with three distinct options:

- Self-inflicted shot (Non-aimed): In this scenario, if the bullet aligns with the barrel, the player will meet a fatal outcome. If not, the player survives and passes the revolver to the next participant.

- Shot at another player (Aimed): Should the bullet align with the barrel, the player will neither meet their demise nor be injured but will fatally harm the targeted opponent. Conversely, if the alignment does not occur, the player will face a fatal consequence.

- Shot fired into the air (Aimed): Similar to the "Shot at another player" scenario, if the bullet aligns with the barrel, no harm will be inflicted on anyone.
